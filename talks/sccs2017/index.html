                    Thank you. I’m Greg Elin. I’m the founder of GovReady PBC. 
                    It makes sense that this presentation on compliance would be one of the last 
                    talks of the day because compliance is always one of the last things we talk about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was just three years ago that I heard about DHS S&amp;T and attended my first 
                    Cyber Showcase.
                <p>
                    I had recently left my appointment as the Chief Data Officer at the 
                    Federal Communications Commission because FISMA compliance was the primary constraint
                    on how fast we could innovate. I wanted to change that and I never ever wanted to be
                    told again I couldn’t use a great technology because it wasn’t compliant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it’s great to be here presenting our funded research on automating security compliance.
                    Thank you Dr. Doug Maughan and Dr. Dan Massey, my recently retired program manager, and my new program manager, Vincent Sritapan.

                    The fact is, today’s cyber compliance process isn’t scaling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maintaining written documentation is too slow for the continuous development and delivery nature of modern IT. Our compliance needs to keep pace with the velocity of open source, cloud, agile, and DevOps.
                <p>
                    Compliance isn’t scaling because interpreting 800-53 controls takes too long. We are told to go read the NIST SP 800-53 and figure out what hundreds of controls really mean to the IT system we are building, controls like SC-7 BOUNDARY PROTECTION which reads in part - <i>"The information system connects to external networks or information systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security architecture."</i>
                <p>
                    Finally, compliance isn’t scaling because our consultant-required unit costs are too high. Our only PKI of compliance is a $100K – $150K SSP and ATO that takes 9 months on average to complete leading us to spend billions annually on FISMA-related activities.

                <p>
                    These packages require days or weeks of training to learn how to use and are essentially just repositories of control descriptions and artifacts.

                    The answer is compliance apps. GovReady compliance apps map system components to compliance controls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of each compliance app as a re-usable data package defining which controls are satisfied by a system component.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The compliance apps are run on GovReady’s open source expert system to guide teams through building secure and compliant IT systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach enables a scalable supply chain of shared, re-suable, compliance paperwork building blocks that do not reveal proprietary details of our individual systems.

                    The compliance apps model makes it almost trivial to answer the question how do I make this software compliant? For any given type of IT system, be it a Drupal web site or a Windows network, an organization can easily proscribe the components (i.e., compliance apps) needed to make the system compliant.

                    Think of it like a tool drawer with cutouts reveals at a glance the tools needed for the job—and which ones are present or missing. Even better, each tool can provide evidence of it proper use.

                    At GovReady we embrace the fact compliance is not security, but is its own of field study; the study of attestation and verification at scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this field needs DHS S&amp;T CSD’s continued support to improve.

                    Telling us <i>"the canine must possess sufficient agility to self-propel aerially through a ringed "</i>" sheds no light on how we train our dog to jump through a hoop.

                <p>
                    Every episode of the Dog Whisperer provides the same lesson: the dog does not respond to what we say, but how we act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To do compliance faster better cheaper, we need to ways to act compliantly that are better faster cheaper.
