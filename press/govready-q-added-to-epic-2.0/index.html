<h1>B&amp;D Consulting, Inc. Incorporates GovReady-Q into EPIC 2.0 to Accelerate FISMA Compliance</h1>

<p><i>May 14, 2018</i></p>

<p><i>Washington, D.C.</i> – Compliance data expert GovReady® PBC is proud to announce a partnership with long time Department of Defense (DoD) contractor and technology solution provider B&amp;D Consulting, Inc. to incorporate the <a href="https://github.com/govready/govready-q">GovReady-Q Compliance Automation Server</a> into B&amp;D's EPIC 2.0 (Extensible and Portable Infrastructure as a Service Cloud) platform. The partnership will enable defense enterprises to quickly and easily generate System Security Plans (SSP) and other compliance documentation by automatically translating configuration information into security control attestations and verification evidence.</p>

<p>GovReady PBC founder Greg Elin, a former Chief Data Officer in the federal government, explains the GovReady's open source software handles compliance information as structured data to dramatically accelerate compliance-related work. "We package questions, rules, and templates into reusable data packages called 'compliance apps' that map the relationship between system components and security controls. This produces a supply-chain of pre-written 'Component Security Plans' that get automatically combined into System Security Plans."</p>

<p>B&amp;D staff, always on the lookout for innovation to better support their customers, learned of GovReady's compliance app technology via the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science & Technology (S&T) where GovReady PBC has an R&D contract which was helping fund the work.  B&amp;D immediately recognized the potential to combined the compliance apps with their EPIC platform to dramatically automate and speed up compliance. </p>

<p>"The combination of B&amp;D's EPIC2.0 and GovReady PBC will provide the government with new levels of security, efficiency and compliance", said Jeff Bearden, CEO of B&amp;D.  "As government clients drive towards modernization of their ecosystems, they now have the ability to securely automate their DevOps, lifecycle and Site Reliability efforts as well as the crucial compliance efforts.  We are excited to team with GovReady to provide our clients with this level of cost and time savings as well as positioning them for new levels of cloud based applications."</p>

<p>B&amp;D's EPIC 2.0 is the premier practice for Enterprise customers to achieve dramatic lifecycle efficiencies for enterprise hosting operations.  EPIC 2.0 drives cost savings, system build efficiencies and outstanding cyber security for clients with small to large ecosystems.  Using the principals of DevOps, Portable Automation and Software Defined/ Modular Builds, and following Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) model EPIC 2.0 brings new tools for government and corporate IT leaders to: 

<ul>
<li>Enhance Cyber security and eliminate recurring task via automation to drive significant reduction in human error and a corresponding increase in security</li>
<li>Create Cloud Migration path for non-cloud ready systems to reduce cost for planning and implementation</li>
<li>Completely automate large systems builds or replication for dramatic reduction in time, operations resources and cost</li>
</ul>

<p>EPIC 2.0 now includes industry leading integrated portal(s) and workflow automation from Kinetic Data (<a href="http://www.kineticdata.com">www.kineticdata.com</a>), replication of mobility applications and security, links to blockchain enabled applications and now, to the leading government compliance application, GovReady-Q. EPIC 2.0 is the optimal tool to automate enterprise Operations and Cyber efforts.</p>

<p><a href="https://govready.com">GovReady PBC</a> is a Maryland-based Public Benefit Corporation whose mission is to lower the cost of innovation in digital services to citizens. GovReady's innovative self-service IT compliance portal was developed as part of a R&D contract to automate and lower the cost of cyber security compliance from the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, Cyber Security Division. </p>
